2. **Wishlist Management**: Users can add items to their wishlist, allowing them to save products for future reference.
3. **Cart System**: Selected products can be added to the cart for review and purchase.
4. **Responsive UI**: The interface is responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices.
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Using React Toastify, the app provides instant feedback to users for actions like adding to cart or wishlist.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling dynamic component-based routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and flexible styling.
- **React Toastify**: For managing notifications.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation across different pages of the site.
- **Context API**: For managing and sharing state globally across the application.

## React Concepts Utilized
- **Components**: Modular, reusable components help in maintaining a clean and organized structure.
- **State and Props**: Used to manage dynamic data and pass information between components.
- **React Context API**: Enables data handling and sharing across components without prop drilling.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and lifecycle (e.g., `useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect`).
- **Conditional Rendering**: Used to display components based on certain conditions.

## Data Management
- **Context API**: Used for state management to maintain the global state of the cart, wishlist, and user selections.
- **Local Storage**: User selections such as wishlist items are stored locally, providing persistent data across sessions.
